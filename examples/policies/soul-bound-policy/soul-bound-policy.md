# Soul Bound Policy

Soul Bound Policy is an example module of Marmalade which provides a simple method to bind a token to an account (soul). In this context, a soul bound token refers to a non-fungible token (NFT) that is uniquely associated with a specific account.

This token can be initiated, minted and burned but not sold or transferred.

Token can be minted by an account only once, even if the token is burned in the future.

## Specification, tables, capabilities:

**Schemas**: `mint-record` is a schema that store information related to the issuance of the token.
  - `account`: refers to an owner of the token.

**Tables**: `records` table stores token supply information.
  - `id` is composed of token id and account

**Capabilities**:
 - `GOVERNANCE`: enforces access control of contract upgrade.
