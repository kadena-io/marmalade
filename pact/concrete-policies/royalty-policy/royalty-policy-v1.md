# Royalty-policy-v1

This policy, `royalty-policy-v1`, is designed to support royalty payouts during the sale of non-fungible token. It implements the `kip.token-policy-v2` interface and extends the functionality provided by the base policy.

  
## Overview

  
This policy module includes the following key components:

**Policy functions**: Several functions that enforce specific rules for token-related actions.

**Royalty Specification**: The `royalty-schema` is a schema designed to store information related to royalties for non-fungible tokens, such as the creator, creator guard, royalty rate, and associated fungible token.

**Royalties Table**: A table, `royalties`, is created to store the royalty information for each non-fungible token (NFT), including the token ID and its associated royalty details. This table ensures proper handling of royalty payouts during token sales and maintains a record of royalty configurations for the NFTs managed under the policy.
  

## Policy Functions

`enforce-init`: By setting the initial royalty information, it guarantees that creators receive their deserved royalties from the value generated by their work, fostering a supportive and thriving environment for artists and collectors alike. This functions sets up the initial paramaters for the token concerning the royalties.

`enforce-buy`: Handles the payment of royalties during the sale, ensuring that the correct sale token is used and the appropriate royalty payout is transferred to the creator. In short this function is the mechanisme that oversees royalty payouts to creators by validating and adhering to the agreed-upon terms between buyer and seller.

## Payload messages


#### ROYALTY_SPEC


The `enforce-init` function initialises a royalty for a fungible token and enforces several checks to ensure the validity of the royalty. The message payload contains the `royalty-schema` object, which has five required fields: `fungible`, `creator`, `creator-guard`, `royalty-rate`, and `quote-policy`.

The `fungible` field specifies the module that contains the fungible token. The `creator` field specifies the creator of the token. The `creator-guard` field specifies a guard that must be satisfied by the creator's details. The `royalty-rate` field specifies the percentage of the sale price that will be charged as a royalty. The `quote-policy` field specifies the policy module that contains the quote policy.

  
Once the `royalty-schema` object has been read from the message payload, the function extracts the relevant fields from it and performs several checks to ensure the validity of the royalty. It then inserts the royalty into the `royalties` database.
